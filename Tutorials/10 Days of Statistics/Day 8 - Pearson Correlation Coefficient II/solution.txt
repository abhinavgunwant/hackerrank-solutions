Answer: -3/4

----------
According to Day 8: Least Square Regression Line's tutorial,
Y = a + bX                  ----eq(I)

for regression line of x on y,
    y = -2 -3/4x            ----eq(1)

for regression line of y on x,
    x = -7/4 -3/4y          ----eq(2)

So, b = -3/4

b = p * (sigma_x / sigma_y), where p is Pearson's correlation coefficient
p = b * (sigma_y / sigma_x)

taking b from eq(1),
    p = -3/4 * (sigma_y / sigma_x)      ----eq(3)

taking b from eq(2),
    p = -3/4 * (sigma_x / sigma_y)      ----eq(4)

multiplying eq(3) and eq(4), we have:
    p^2 = 9/16
    p = Â±3/4

in eq(I), b is the slope of the line
since the slope of the line is negative in both
the lines, p is negative

Hence, p = -3/4
