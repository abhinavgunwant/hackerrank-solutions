Answer: 12 / 51

----------
Total combination: 52 * 51

No of ways for drawing 2 cards of same suit from 52 cards:
    52C1 * 12C1

    where 52C1 is the ways 1 card can be drawn from 52 cards
    and 12C1 is the ways 1 card can be drawn from the same suit as the first card!

P(2 cards drawn from 52 card deck without replacement have same color):
    = ( 52C1 * 12C1 ) / ( 52C1 * 51C1 )
    = ( 52 * 12 ) / ( 52 * 51 )
    = 12 / 51
