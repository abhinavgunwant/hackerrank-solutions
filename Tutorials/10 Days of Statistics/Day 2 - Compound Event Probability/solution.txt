Answer: 17/42

----------
P(Red ball in urn A) = 4/7
P(Red ball in urn B) = 5/9
P(Red ball in urn C) = 1/2
P(Black ball in urn A) = 3/7
P(Black ball in urn B) = 4/9
P(Black ball in urn C) = 1/2

P(2 red and 1 black ball)
= P(red red black) + P(red black red) + P(black red red)
= (4/7)*(5/9)*(1/2) + (4/7)*(4/9)*(1/2) + (3/7)*(5/9)*(1/2)
= 51/126
= 17/4
